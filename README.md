# REST_API_AI_ETL
Exploring REST API, openai API and ETL

The file SDW2023.csv contains a simple structure with a UserID and id numbers that is used to retrieve data from the simple fastapi script that I created because the official API isn't working.

simple_api.py is an API that sends the user information and can receive a PUT to add the information to a list.

main.py uses the fundamentals of REST API and ETL to generate a marketing message for a bank user.
